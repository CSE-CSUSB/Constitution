# CSE Constitution

The CSE Constitution is the governing document of the Computer Science & Engineering Club at CSU, San Bernardino. It is presented here for students to offer input, and so that anyone can at any time access the current version of the document.

The document is submitted to Student Leadership and Development (SLD) at the end of the each academic year so the club can be chartered. At that point whatever version of the document has been submitted to them is the one that governs the club. New versions may be submitted but shall not be considered official until they have been accepted by SLD.
