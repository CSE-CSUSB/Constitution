# CSE Club Constitution

This is the repository for the official CSUSB Computer Science and Engineering Club Constitution. It's status represents the current binding laws of the organization, as agreed upon by a vote of the membership at the end of each academic year.

## Usage

The original documents are written in Markdown and contained in the `src` directory. The build script is then used to compile them into `html`, `pdf`, and `docx`. The script relies on the presence of Python 2.7 and Pandoc on the user's system.

To build the Constitution into its various formats:

- Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed
- Make sure you have Pandoc installed
- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Run `./build` from the location you cloned the repository to

## Contributions

Because of the nature of this repository, it is only to be edited when the time comes for the submission of a new Constitution to CSUSB's Student Leadership and Development office, or when an Ammendment is made via the standard ammendment procedure. Modifications to this repository will not be accepted except under those circumstances.
