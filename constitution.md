# Amendments

## 1st Amendment: The Union of the ACM and IEEE Student Chapters

With this amendment, the Computer Science and Engineering Club becomes both the
ACM and IEEE student chapter at CSUSB. This amendment describes the structure
of the reorganization, including modifications to officer positions and
responsibilities, and addition of the IEEE Code of Ethics to our attendant
ethical standards alongisde the ACM Code of Ethics. The following sections
describe the reorganized officer structure, making special note of any
particularly important changes in title or duties.

### Officer Reorganization

#### President

The President shall be listed as the President of both the ACM Student Chapter
and IEEE Student Chapter. While the President is the official head of both
student chapters, the regular administration of those organizations (including
management of any necessary reporting) shall be left to the two Vice Presidents
whose positions are defined below.

#### Vice President of the ACM Student Chapter

The VP for ACM is in charge of the regular administration of the ACM Student
Chapter, including the management of any necessary reporting or compliance.
Their duties will otherwise be consistent with the standard duties of a CSE
Club Vice President. They shall be listed as the Vice President of the student
organization with the ACM.

#### Vice President of the IEEE Student Chapter

The VP for IEEE is in charge of the regular administration of the IEEE Student
Chapter, including the management of any necessary reporting or compliance.
Their duties will otherwise be consistent with the standard duties of a CSE
Club Vice President. They shall be listed as the Vice President of the student
organization with the IEEE.

#### Treasurer

The Treasurer shall be listed as the Treasurer with both the ACM and IEEE, and
shall be in charge of all currently listed constitutional duties, as well as
any stipulated by the ACM and IEEE for that position.

#### Secretary

The Secretary shall be listed as the Secretary with both the ACM and IEEE, and
shall be in charge of all currently listed constitutional duties, as well as
any stipulated by the ACM and IEEE for that position.

### Membership Dues

#### Officers

If the President, Vice President of ACM, Vice President of IEEE, Treasurer, or
Secretary wishes to have their required ACM or IEEE membership fees paid for
by the CSE Club, they may request payment from the Board, subject to approval
by a majority vote of the Board, discounting the requesting individual. Such
payments are allowed only for the duration of the Board member's tenure in a
position which requires payment of relevant organizational dues.

#### Members

CSE Club members who wish to also be student members of the ACM or IEEE are
responsible for their own payment of dues independent of the club. CSE Club
members may request financial assistance for the payment of ACM or IEEE dues,
which must be approved via the standard voting procedure for the Board.

It is the responsibility of the ACM VP and IEEE VP to track ACM and IEEE
student memberships within the CSE Club.

### Presidential Succession

If the President steps down or is removed from office, the position must be
filled by either the Vice President of ACM or Vice President of IEEE, to be
selected by a majority vote of the Board. An election is then held to fill the
vacated Vice Presidential position, per the standard election procedure.
